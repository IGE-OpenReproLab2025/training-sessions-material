# Proposed collaboration and dissemination workflow : 

We here propose a standard workflow for you to develop the supporting material for your intership in a reproducible manner. 

The main objectives of this workflow are to : 
 - help you organise your interactions with your immediate collaborators in order to maximize the outcome of your meetings
 - help you think about how to package you processing chains (in notebooks, scripts, libraries) as you are developping your progress
 - make sure that you can trace back your result and identify possible mistakes and bugs afterwards 

You may need to adapt some aspects of this workflow to the specific of your internship, but my default we would like you try and adopt this approach. It is based on years of experience with student projects. 

The work flow we proposed is based on three different GitHub repositories, which will serve different purposes and target audience. 

## Your own personal lab-book
This is where you will store your work on a daily basis. This repository can be public if you want, but we recommend you make it private, for you only. It should be your safe space. 

## A collaboration hub on this projec
This is where you will  store the material for interacting with your collaborators on this project. This repository can be public if you want, but we recommend you make it private, and accessible to you and your collaborators only.

## A open place for sharing your work. 
This is where you will storing the all the material  for reproducing your work. This repository should be public. 

## In practice 
We will now go through the different templates that we have prepared :
