# Python basics and going further

## Introduction: Coding Spirit

Let's get straight to the point: what's the most important thing about a piece of code or software? What quality must it possess to become a masterpiece? The answer may vary, and will no doubt be hotly debated. But can we reach a consensus?

**<p align="center">Maintainable</p>**

Not performant, not safe, not reliable, not even efficient or functional. Nothing is more of a priority than making code maintainable, because it then becomes capable of getting all the other qualities.

Code designed to last maximizes its chances of being reused, improved and so on. And this, including by others, thus increasing the efforts that fuel this virtuous circle.

> A high-performance, easy-to-use open-source library... it's tempting, isn't it? But what about the day when a big bug is found in it and nobody wants/can fix it because the code is an incomprehensible mess? Well, it's a dead library, and all your programs that use it will have to migrate. Lame.
