 Welcome to IGE OpenReproLab 2025 ! 
 
##  About *computing plateform* (ige-calcul): 

an experimental structure funded by IGE as an internal project for fostering exchanges on scientific computing, data processing, numerical tools

aiming at  : 
 - aggregating existing knowledge : documentation on tools and computing infractructures 
 - promoting good practices in terms of code development and data management 
 - helping our navigation through an evolving technological landscape (infrastructures, resources)

in practice : 
 - a community of about 40 contributors across the lab
 - a jupyterbook : https://ige-calcul.github.io/public-docs/


## About OpenReproLab 
A new initiative for fostering open science and reproducible practices at IGE (official agenda), and test our new computing infrastructure (hidden agenda !). 

What we will (try to) provide : 
 - a computing environment : jupyterhub + cloud storage
 - training material : https://github.com/IGE-OpenReproLab2025/training-sessions-material
 - technical support : on site on Thursday afternoons and through  

What we are expecting from you : 
 - use the computing environment and attend the training session ! 
 - do your best to follow our advice on the tools and workflows 
 - deliver a GitHub repository with all the material allowing to reproduced the results of your internship  

A ReproHack will be organised in early July (TBD) for testing how reproducible is your work. The most “reproducible” internship will be awarded a prize. 
 
 
## Cautionary remarks 
We are doing our best for this effort to be useful, we will strive to make it so, but keep in mind that this effort is still experimental. We will all learn as we go, so we thank you in advance for your understanding and your positive mindset.
