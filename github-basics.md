# GITHUB BASICS

## WHAT IS GITHUB

GitHub is a web-based platform that allows users to store and share code, collaborate with others, and manage version control. 
With some of its options, it is also possible to automate tests, discuss with users or collaborators and manage an entire project.
It can also host static websites directly from a repository.

## WHY USE GITHUB

- store the code and its history of developments online (back-up)
- download/upload it to/from any machine (distribute)
- share code easily with others (notebooks are rendered on github)
- community of users : you can interact, follow other people's work
- easy to work together on the same project
